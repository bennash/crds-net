                    It all started at a church conference. Crossroads Senior Pastor Brian Tome met an African pastor
                    named
                    Titus. God made it clear that a (then) small church from Cincinnati could help fight the AIDS crisis
                    ravaging impoverished black townships in South Africa. That was nearly two decades ago. The work has
                    evolved, but we’re still there and the fight continues.

                    1 out of every 4 of those are children. Very early in the life of Crossroads, God called our
                    community into some of the darkest places on earth. As it turns out, those are the places most in

                    Our work in Southeast Asia is focused on putting an end to human trafficking and sexual slavery. It
                    is some of the hardest work on earth. We’ve forged partnerships, developed relationships, and seen
                    God work incredible miracles. So yes, we will continue to get on our knees before God and ask him to
                    heal our world. But, we’ll also get on planes and ask Him to help us be part of the solution.

                  came from Freeset. And while you might not have known it, your shirt helped save a woman from sexual
                  slavery. Located in Sonagacchi, the largest, most infamous sex district in India, Freeset is a
                  beachhead for hope. They employ women who might otherwise have to sell themselves, restoring their
                  dignity and giving them the ability to provide for their families. This work is so profoundly amazing
                  that we will be doubling down on our efforts of giving away free shirts. </p>

                    In 2015 Crossroads did something that no other church community on earth has ever done. In one
                    weekend, we sponsored over 6,000 vulnerable kids living below the poverty line in Nicaragua through
                    our partner Compassion International. It was the single largest sponsorship event of its kind and it
                    began yet another incredible call by God to bring relief to those who need it most. But the work is
                    larger than just a monthly Compassion payment. Why? Because when Crossroads gets involved, we’re all
                    in. (Want another cool example? Visit <a

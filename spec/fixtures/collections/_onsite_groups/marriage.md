description: "It’s until death do us part. Then come eternal rewards or regrets depending
  on how we spent  our lives.  \n\nIn his latest book, Francis Chan and his wife Lisa
  address the question that many couples wonder at the altar: “How do I have a great
  marriage?” Setting aside typical topics on marriage, Francis and Lisa dive into
  Scripture to understand what it means to have a relationship that satisfies the
  deepest parts of our souls.\n\nYou and Me Forever: Marriage in Light of Eternity
  will radically shift the way we see one of our most important earthly relationships:
  marriage.\n\nJesus was right. We have it all backwards. The way to have a great
  marriage is to not focus on marriage.\n\nThis book study by Francis Chan will help
  you discover the adventure that you were made for and learn how to thrive in it.\n\n"

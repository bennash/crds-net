  This is a 9-week course filled with people who want to transform their approach to finances and become good managers of the resources God has provided. Financial Peace University presents biblical, practical steps showing you how to get rid of debt, manage your money, have a single financial vision as a married couple, spend and save wisely, and much more.

  There is a cost of $109 per household (i.e. one single person or one married couple). The $109 is a one-time fee that covers the purchase of your materials. Once you have the materials, you can return to any future FPU group for free.

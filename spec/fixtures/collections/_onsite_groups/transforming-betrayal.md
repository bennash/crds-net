  This is a group for women who have experienced the pain of their spouse's or partners betrayal through infidelity, pornography, or compulsive sexual behavior of any kind.  The group is broken up into two-parts. Your first step will be to attend an Introduction meeting.  Then you can sign up for the first part of the 2-part class.

  INTRODUCTION MEETINGS
  Monthly introduction meetings are for women who have just discovered the betrayal. Get materials to help until the next session begins. Just coming to an info session does not commit you to the group.

  description: Located near the University of Cincinnati campus, Crossroads Uptown
    serves the college community and Uptown neighborhoods north of downtown Cincinnati.
    Built in 1873, the building was once home to St. George Catholic Church. The church
    closed, and in 2008 the beloved steeples burned in an electrical fire. With a
    mission to breathe new life into the neighborhood, Crossroads purchased the building,
    and agreed to restore the steeples. The result is a state-of-the-art building
    that combines the industrial feel of Crossroads with the historic character of
    the original Catholic church.
